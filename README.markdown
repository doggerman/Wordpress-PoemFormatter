Stable tag: 0.0.4

A plugin that allows to format poems in a proper and easy way. It provides some small control tags to allow adjustment to the layout.

## Description ##

This plugin generates charts from GPX-files. The file will be processed in real-time, no intermediate data is written to the database or the wp-content directory. Currently the plugin is tested with GPX-Files generated by a Garmin-Device.
The TRK-Section is parsed and information about your heartrate, your cadence and the current speed is calculated. Since GPX-files can contain a lot of data-points they can be reduced to a certain amount to guarantee, that the rendering time of the chart won't consume to much time in your browser.
You can hover with the mouse over the generated chart to get detailed information about the currently selected time-instance. You can also turn off graphs that where currently shown. Every graph get its own Y-axis and color.
You can also zoom into the graph to get more details.

The graphs are generated with the [Highcharts-API](http://www.highcharts.com/). Please respect their license and pricing (Free for Non-Commercial).

Current development will allow to use [Flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/) instead of Highcharts. It is released under [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) and will be therefore more compatible to GPL.
